          One is the Zenith. She is extremely soft, snow white with spots of
          stardust grey, and has a tiny pink nose. She will offer you answers in
          times of uncertainty.
        </p>
        <p>
          One is the Nadir. She is very fluffy, wearing a tux the colour of deep
          space with her starlight coloured belly and legs showing, her face
          remains shrouded in mystery. Her cries echo in the dawning sky.

              <strong>Sleeping Ratio</strong><br /><br />
              Sleeping is the only true way of not getting annoyed, therefore 
              maintaining long sleep hours is crucial to your health;
              Already multiple days this year where an asleep-to-awake-time
              ratio of over 4 could be achieved, the highest being 4.7

              <strong>Fighting for Food</strong><br /><br />
              No matter how scarce the two-leggers will make your food rations, 
              it is important to make sure to never enjoy it but always inhale 
              multiple pieces as if they were one large prey
            </p>
          </div>

              <strong>Eardrum Piercing</strong><br /><br />
              After successfully inhaling your food it is just as important to make 
              it known to every human and feline in the area that this was not enough; 
              Screaming is the only way
             </p>

              <strong>Being in the Way</strong><br /><br />
              It as practically an art form to look for the most not-for-you area which 
              will also block someone's intended next action for your every rest

              <strong>Drug Consumption</strong><br /><br />
              Doesn't sound good, but keeping your grass and herb levels high is the only 
              way to ensure crazy times and regular regurgitating

              <strong>Resting Regularly</strong><br /><br />
              Next to sleeping and eating, resting is an often overlooked but highly 
              efficient way of doing nothing

              It is your never-ending duty to kill with torture; It doesn't matter 
              if you intend to eat it, you will kill it, and you will enjoy doing it

              After every annoying, repulsive or gruesome behaviour, make sure to act as 
              ridiculously cute as your given physical attributes will allow to play with everyone's emotions
