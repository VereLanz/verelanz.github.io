          One is the Zenith. She is extremely soft, snow white with spots of
          stardust grey, and has a tiny pink nose. She will offer you answers in
          times of uncertainty.
        </p>
        <p>
          One is the Nadir. She is very fluffy, wearing a tux the colour of deep
          space with her starlight coloured belly and legs showing, her face
          remains shrouded in mystery. Her cries echo in the dawning sky.

              <strong>Sleeping Ratio</strong><br /><br />
              Sleeping is the only reliable way for not getting annoyed, therefore 
              maintaining long sleep hours is crucial to your health;
              Already multiple days this year an asleep-to-awake-time
              ratio of over 4 could be achieved, the highest being 4.7
            </p>

              <strong>Fighting for Food</strong><br /><br />
              No matter how scarce the two-leggers will make your food rations, 
              it is important to make sure to never enjoy it but always inhale 
              multiple pieces as if they were one large prey
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>

          <div>
            <p>
              <strong>Eardrum Piercing</strong><br /><br />
              After successfully inhaling your food it is just as important to make 
              it known to every human and feline in the area that this was not enough; 
              Screaming is the only way
             </p>

              <strong>Being in the Way</strong><br /><br />
              It as practically an art form to look for the most not-for-you area which 
              will also block someone's intended next action for your every rest
            </p>

              <strong>Drug Consumption</strong><br /><br />
              Doesn't sound good, but keeping your grass and herb levels high is the only 
              way to ensure crazy times and regular regurgitating

              <strong>Resting Regularly</strong><br /><br />
              Next to sleeping and eating, resting is an often overlooked but highly 
              efficient way of doing nothing
            </p>

              <strong>Never Stop Killing</strong><br /><br />
              It is your never-ending duty to kill with torture; It doesn't matter 
              if you intend to eat it, you will kill it, and you will enjoy doing it

              <strong>Being Too Cute</strong><br /><br />
              After every annoying, repulsive or gruesome behaviour, make sure to act as 
              ridiculously cute as your given physical attributes will allow to play with everyone's emotions
